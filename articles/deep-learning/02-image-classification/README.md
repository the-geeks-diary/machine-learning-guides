# Introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This is the code accompanying the [article]() on my blog [thegeeksdiary](https://thegeeksdiary.com).

## Environment Setup
---

We will be using the tensorflow image with jupyter notebook that is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/thegeeksdiary/tensorflow-jupyter-gpu), this image comes with all bells and whistles properly setup and we can use it to spin up a new docker environment with proper libraries for deep learning and machine learning.

The docker container can be started using the follwoing commands:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The configurations are defined in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
