# Tensorflow GPU With Jupyter Notebooks

We are providing a docker image with most of the libraries pre-installed for running a full fledged machine learning environment using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) inside docker with GPU support. The docker image uses the base image provided by [nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/)
